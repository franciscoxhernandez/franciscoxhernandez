## 👋 Hi there, I'm Francisco!

I'm a curious engineer, researcher, and problem-solver currently transitioning into the world of **AI and Cloud Engineering**.

- 🧠 **PhD Researcher** @ TU Chemnitz, exploring how telepresence robots can enhance remote collaboration and digital work  
- 🌩️ **AI & Cloud Engineering** @ Masterschool – learning how to building full-stack apps, APIs, machine learning tools and cloud applications
- 🤖 I love merging **human factors**, **robotics**, and **software engineering**  
- 🔧 Former **automotive engineer** and logistics planner — now reprogramming myself one Python script at a time  
- 💬 Ask me about: Python, SQL, APIs, research, productivity tools, or how to improve online and hybrid meetings
- 🌍 I speak **English**, **German**, **Spanish**, and **Italian**   
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm an automotive engineer without a car 🚲
